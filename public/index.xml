      <description>&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s my story - I grew up in a small town in Rajasthan, raised by my kickass single mom and elder sister. School was my thing, and when I hit 11th grade, I fell hard for C++ programming. Like every other Indian kid with decent grades, I ended up at Allen Institute Kota for IIT-JEE prep. Spoiler alert: The pressure cooker environment there? Yeah, not my scene.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Landed at BIT Bangalore for telecommunications engineering instead. Failed a year - but honestly? That turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Instead of moping around, I hit the gym and dove deep into programming classes. Best decision ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
