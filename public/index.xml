      <title>How I Went from a Small Town Kid to Working on Cutting-Edge AI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s my story - I grew up in a small town in Rajasthan, raised by my kickass single mom and elder sister. School was my thing, and when I hit 11th grade, I fell hard for C++ programming. Like every other Indian kid with decent grades, I ended up at Allen Institute Kota for IIT-JEE prep. Spoiler alert: The pressure cooker environment there? Yeah, not my scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landed at BIT Bangalore for telecommunications engineering instead. Failed a year - but honestly? That turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Instead of moping around, I hit the gym and dove deep into programming classes. Best decision ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there fellow startup builder! I have been an early stage engineer with some product chops for around 8 years now having worked with a half dozen startups from bootstrapped/pre-seed funded to unicorns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My base is in my hometown Udaipur, India and I have been exploring digital nomad lifestyle traveling around south east Asia from last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m at a stage in my life / career where I want to double down on working towards things that I&amp;rsquo;m really passionate about and gives me a sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
